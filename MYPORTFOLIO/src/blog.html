        <h1><a href="#My Simple Life">My simple <em>life</em> is a complex life it seems!</a></h1>
          <p>
            <em>A little over a decade ago</em> my life was not as it is today. I owned a home or shall we say mortgaged a house at the age of 21, got a chocolate Labrador named Diesel (who we'll talk about later in the blog) and "thought" I had a stable career in the Oil&Gas Energy Industry.
            <br> Then came the Oil&Gas Crash of 2008/2009, along with the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac debacle of Mortgage Finance.
            <br> At the time I had just remodeled my home after an internal flood and had put around 40K-50k into it as I "thought" I was "investing" my hard earned $ into an asset.
            <br> Shortly after, Work dried up and life felt like quicksand. I lost everything in the matter of months, packed everything I rightfully owned and stored it. Moved back home for several months, until I got a call from a former Broker, I call her "Big Mama" and she calls me "Son"! (but that story's for another time).
            <br>Big Mama asked me to head out to Pampa, TX for a project! (Little did I know at the time, but the best years of my life were about to begin!)
            <br>I worked in Pampa, TX for around 3 months. I did titlework, producing spreadsheets/reports for mineral rights and heirship for the purpose of obtaining Oil&Gas Leases on behalf of our clients. 
            <br>At the time I was battling with my first touch of depression. I'd never felt anything like it, depression just comes with the stress of debt collectors calling day and night, being alone in a hotel room in the middle of what seems like nowhere Texas and having just lost everything I thought was "Valuable" in my life at the time. Before this I had no way to relate with anyone who'd ever gone through it because i'm a very happy and outgoing person generally.
            <br>After a brief stint there, Big Mama, asked me to go to Greeley, CO and something instantly lifted in me. 
            <br>When I was around 16/17 years old, about 15 friends and myself all took a vacation to learn to snowboard in Angel Fire, NM. It was one of my favorite things to do (but I didn't get the oppurtunity to do it often.)
            <br>At 24 years old, getting to live in Colorado and be near the Rocky Mountains, was a fantasy that I never imagined could become a reality.
            <br> <strong>I WAS READY TO GO! and I MEAN READY!</strong>
